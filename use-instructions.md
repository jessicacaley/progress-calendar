## Instructions for Use
### Temporary
Open file on CS50's IDE, cs50.io. Compile the file by using the "make" commmand followed by the file name (without ".c") in the command line. To run, type "./" followed by the file name (without ".c").
### Permanent
I need to learn common practices for compiling and using C files outside of Harvard's CS50 framework.
